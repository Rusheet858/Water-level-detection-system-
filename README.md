# Water level detection system

This is an IOT project that detects water level in a container using aarduino uno where rduino IDE is used for configuring the arduino. This project involves using LED lights which turn on with respect to change in water level. When the water level is at its lowest, blue light will turn on, in the medium level, yelllow level will turn on and when the water level is at its highest, red light will turn on along with buzzer which will notify that the water level is critical.
